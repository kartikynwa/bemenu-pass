# bemenu-pass

Based on the brilliant `rofi-pass` which can be found
[here](https://github.com/carnager/rofi-pass).

Changes include:

- Using [`bemenu`](https://github.com/Cloudef/bemenu) instead of [`rofi`](https://github.com/carnager/rofi).
- Using [`wtype`](https://github.com/atx/wtype) instead of `xdotool`.

## Usage

Refer to the [README of `rofi-pass`](https://github.com/carnager/rofi-pass/blob/master/README.md).
I would like keep the basic functionalities the same but the plan is to strip
the features that are not used by me so I can manage the code.
